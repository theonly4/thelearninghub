      correct_answer: "b",
      rationale: "Covered entities and business associates must limit PHI access, use, and disclosure to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. Even if authorized for billing, employees cannot access information beyond what is needed. Psychiatric notes are not minimum necessary for a billing discrepancy resolution.",

      correct_answer: "b",
      rationale: "45 CFR §164.508 mandates that uses and disclosures of PHI for purposes other than treatment, payment, or healthcare operations require written authorization signed by the individual. A verbal request, even if documented, does not meet this standard.",
