      scenario: "A health tech startup employee needs to access patient medical records to resolve a billing discrepancy. The employee is authorized to process billing, but the records contain detailed psychiatric notes unrelated to billing.",

        { id: "d", label: "D", text: "Access the record but ignore the psychiatric data" },
      ],
      correct_answer: "b",
      rationale: "Covered entities and business associates must limit PHI access, use, and disclosure to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. Even if authorized for billing, employees cannot access information beyond what is needed. Psychiatric notes are not minimum necessary for a billing discrepancy resolution.",

        { id: "d", label: "D", text: "No, but verbal authorization with documentation works" },
      ],
      correct_answer: "b",
      rationale: "45 CFR §164.508 mandates that uses and disclosures of PHI for purposes other than treatment, payment, or healthcare operations require written authorization signed by the individual. A verbal request, even if documented, does not meet this standard. The authorization must contain specific elements including: identification of the person to whom disclosure is made, description of information, expiration date, and patient signature.",

      ],
      correct_answer: "b",
      rationale: "Quick recovery does not eliminate breach risk. The startup must conduct a risk assessment to determine if there is a low probability that the PHI was accessed or compromised. Factors to consider include: nature and extent of PHI, who accessed it, what was done with it, and mitigation measures. Only if the risk assessment determines LOW probability of compromise may notification be waived per §164.402(2).",

      rationale: "45 CFR §164.501 defines 'healthcare operations' narrowly: quality assessment, care coordination, utilization review, competency evaluation, and related activities.

      correct_answer: "c",
      rationale: "45 CFR §164.526 grants individuals the right to request amendment of PHI. A covered entity may deny amendment if the information is accurate.
